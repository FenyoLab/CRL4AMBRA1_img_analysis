Run plotting_graphs.py to create the output plots.  Extended Data Figure 5d is entitled "Change_in_Mean_CYD1_CI.pdf"  Raw data is in "All_Data_Change_in_Mean_CYD1.txt"  The output has been included as part of the repository. 

The input to plotting_graphs.py is the results of the cell tracking scripts.  (the files titled "tracked_cells.csv").  The tracking scripts are also provided for reference ("cell_tracking.py" and "cell_segmentation.py") but this step requires the movie files (not provided here).
